# 🎨 Using Your Own Icon (Untitled.png)

Great news! You already have a beautiful icon (`Untitled.png`), so you don't need to generate new ones from scratch!

## 🖼️ Your Icon

Your `Untitled.png` features a toaster with a "TO DO LIST" paper - perfect for your Schedio calendar app!

## ❓ Why Convert to Different Sizes?

PWAs require specific icon sizes for different purposes:

### 192x192 pixels
- 📱 **Android home screen** icon
- 🔍 **App drawer** display
- 📲 **Install prompt** preview

### 512x512 pixels  
- 🎨 **Splash screen** when launching
- 🖥️ **High-res displays** (Retina, 4K)
- 🏪 **PWA store listings** (if applicable)

### Why Not Just One Size?

- Different devices need different resolutions
- Browsers automatically pick the best size for each use
- Ensures your icon looks sharp on all screens
- Required by PWA standards for installation

## ✅ How to Convert Your Icon

### Step 1: Open the Converter
Double-click `convert-icon.html` in your browser

### Step 2: Upload Your Icon
- Drag and drop `Untitled.png` onto the upload area, or

## 🚀 Deploy
