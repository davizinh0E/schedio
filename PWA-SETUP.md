# 📱 Schedio PWA Setup Guide

Your Schedio calendar app has been successfully converted to a Progressive Web App (PWA)!

## ✅ What Was Added

1. **manifest.json** - Defines your app's metadata, icons, and behavior
2. **service-worker.js** - Enables offline functionality and caching
3. **PWA meta tags** - Added to schedio.html for better mobile support
4. **Service Worker registration** - Automatically registers when the app loads
5. **generate-icons.html** - Tool to create your app icons

## 🎨 Step 1: Generate Icons

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click both download buttons to save:
   - `icon-192.png`
   - `icon-512.png`
3. Place both icons in the same folder as `schedio.html`

## 🚀 Step 2: Serve Your App

PWAs require HTTPS or localhost to work. Choose one of these methods:

### Option A: Using Python (Recommended)
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

### Option B: Using Node.js (http-server)
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run
http-server -p 8000
```

### Option C: Using PHP
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Option D: Using Live Server (VS Code Extension)
- Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
- Right-click on `schedio.html`
- Select "Open with Live Server"

## 📲 Step 3: Install the PWA

1. Open `http://localhost:8000/schedio.html`
2. Look for the install icon (➕) in the address bar
3. Click it and select "Install"
4. The app will open in its own window!

### On Mobile (Android):
1. Open the app in Chrome
2. Tap the three-dot menu
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"

2. Tap the Share button (📤)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"

### Add Installation Button:
You can add a custom install button in your app:

```javascript
// In your React component
const [installPrompt, setInstallPrompt] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setInstallPrompt(e);
  });
}, []);

const handleInstall = () => {
  if (installPrompt) {
    installPrompt.prompt();
    installPrompt.userChoice.then((choice) => {
      if (choice.outcome === 'accepted') {
        console.log('User accepted install');
      }
      setInstallPrompt(null);
    });
  }
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
